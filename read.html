                        Astronomy is the study of everything in space. We study all different kinds of objects 
                        that are beyond our planet earth including other planets, the moon, just about anything 
                        we can see in the sky and can’t see!  We study these objects using special instruments and 
                        tools such as telescopes which help astronomers study these objects.

                        The solar system is a system of planets, moons, and other objects that orbit around our star, the sun. 
                        There are eight planets that orbit the sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth (our planet), Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. 
                        The four closest planets to the sun are called terrestrial planets because they have hard surfaces, The four furthest planets 
                        from the sun are called the gas giants because of how large they are with a surface made up of gas.

                        Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system, only slightly bigger than our moon. 
                        It is also the closet planet to the sun. It orbits the sun every 88 days which means a year on Mercury is only 88 days! 
                        This planet is named after the Roman god Mercurius. It is also made up of mostly iron and its surface mostly covered in silicate rocks and metals.

                        Venus is the second planet closest to the sun and the brightest planet we can see in the night sky. 
                        It is also the hottest planet in our solar system with the average temperature being 867 degrees °F! 
                        Venus was named for the roman goddess Aphrodite, which means love and beauty. It orbits the dun every 225 days, 
                        which is just a little less than Earth’s orbital period.

                        Earth is the planet that we live on! It is mostly made up with water, 
                        and the only planet with water in our solar system. It is also the only planet 
                        that can sustain life, hence why we are the only planet to have any known life in our solar system. 
                        However, most of the feature on Earth that make it possible to sustain life are changing due to climate change. 
                        The name Earth comes from Old English and Germanic, which simply means “the ground”. It takes Earth 365 days to orbit the sun, 
                        which is how we calculate years.

                        Mars is also known as “the red planet” because of its red appearance. 
                        In fact, it’s so red, that it’s easy to spot in the night sky, as it looks like a red dot in the sky. 
                        It’s a dry, cold, and rocky planet that we’ve been able to land rovers on to explore more about it. 
                        It takes Mars 687 days to orbit the sun. Which means it takes a little under 2 Earth years for Mars to complete a year. 
                        Mars was named by the ancient romans for their “god of war”.

                        Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system. It’s so big, that 11 Earth’s can fit across width of Jupiter! 
                        It is notable for its stripes and big red dot called the “The Great Red Spot “which is a giant storm that has been 
                        going on for more than 300 years! It takes approximately 11.68 years for Jupiter to orbit the sun however, a day on 
                        Jupiter is only 9 hours. Jupiter was named after the king of the roman gods.

                        Saturn is most known for its rings and is known as the ring planet. The rings are made up of billions of chucks of ice and rock covered in dust. 
                        It has the most moons of any planet in the solar system with 146 moons! It takes Saturn 29.45 years to make a complete rotation around the sun. 
                        Saturn was named Old English and Germanic.

                    Uranus is a very cold and windy planet with faint rings like Saturn’s and is also the only planet that spins on its side. 
                    Uranus has a green and blue appearance and that’s due to the large amounts of methane that absorbs red light and allows blues 
                    to be reflected back into space. It takes Uranus about 84 years to complete its orbit around the sun. Uranus was named for the 
                    Greek god of the sky, Uranus.

                        It is dark, cold, and whipped by supersonic sounds. Like Uranus, Neptune gets its blue 
                        appearance comes from methane which absorbs red light and allows blues to be reflected back into space. 
                        It takes Neptune an astonishing 165 years to orbit the sun! It is also the first planet to be discovered 
                        using math by German astronomer Johann Galle in 1846. Getting its name from the roman God of the Sea. 
                        Which was suggested by French astronomer Urbain Le Verrier, who gave Galle the math calculations to make the planet’s discovery.

                        Pluto is a dwarf planet that was once considered the 9th planet in our solar system. 
                        It’s since been reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006 because it is not big enough to 
                        exert its orbital dominance and clear the neighborhood surrounding its orbit. Pluto is a world 
                        filled with mountains, valleys, plains, craters, and even glaciers! It takes Pluto a whopping 248 years 
                        to orbit the sun! It was discovered in 1930 by astronomer Clyde Tombaugh. Pluto got its name from 11-year-old Venetia Burney.
